### Terminal wordgame

This is a wordgame that is run on the terminal. 
There might be some resemblance to a famous wordgame but not in any way related. This is just a small self-learning/hobby project.
For now, supports only hardcoded words in wordlist.csv


TODO (maybe/maybe not):
- Background color highlight currently doesn't care about how often the character exists in the word.
- experiments with Make/CMake
- tests?
